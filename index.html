		<h2> Ecological Commitment </h2>
		<p> As many others, sustainability is one of my priority. I am part of the association Esp’r, which its mission is to promote the SSE (social and solidarity economy) and sustainable development on campus. Esp'r organizes conferences, forums and networking events with SSE actors. We launched last year a grocery store : L’Épicerie Le Local. The objective is to provide students and school staff with an alternative to supermarkets, which is more respectful of the environment and the surrounding territories, all at affordable prices to adapt to student budgets.  </p>

		<h2> Cinephile </h2>
		<p> I am also in a movie club, called Making Of, and every Sunday evening we are screening films in an amphitheater for students. I also organize conferences where we invite people from the movie industry. Finally, we make previews of short and feature films, where film crews are invited. Last year, I got the chance to go to Cannes and Deauville where the American film festival happens.  </p>
